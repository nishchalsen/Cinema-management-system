# Cinema-management-system
## UCL coursework

- Coded in python with GUI interface called Tkinter and used sqlite3 for the database
-	Each cinema branch has its own unique database.
- Movies can be added in two ways: You can manually add them or add them by searching online for that particular movie (used an API).
-	In the program, you can schedule cinema movie times (Admin user) and choose movie then book seats (Customer user). 

These are just some accounts I created to access my cinema booking system.
All my data is stored in a MySQL database.
